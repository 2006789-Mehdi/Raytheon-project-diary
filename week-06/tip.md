# Tips for this week

This week, me and my team's time working together mainly served the purpose of reflecting upon the frist sprint week: aspects in which we could've done better and how could we approach the second sprint week whilst taking the feedback into account. To begin with, I mainly argued 2 points, the first being that our SCRUM meetings had considerable room for improvement as our current one was not vocal, proactive and authoritative enough. Therefore, the action to take in order to warrant smoother workflow & communication was to either swap around the SCRUM MASTER role between team members or to simply appoint someone else. 

Secondly, another thing we could have done better is referring back to the MoSCoW analysis more. I feel that although the analysis is mainly done to support the team defining the 'shape' and scope of the project, some of the team did not refer back to it enough. As a result, gradually as we went into the sprint week, the team started drifting off the core requirements and got carried away by spending time in trivial functionalities.
